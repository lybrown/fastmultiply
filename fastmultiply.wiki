====== Seriously fast multiplication (8-bit and 16-bit) ======

By Jackasser

Without further explanation here's the code for really fast multiplications. They require 2k of tables which can be generated using [[table_generator_routine_for_fast_8_bit_mul_table]]. The article from C=Hacking 16 which is mentioned in the source is available [[magazines:chacking16#d_graphics_for_the_masseslib3d_and_cool_world|here]].

Here are four routines, signed/unsigned 8/16-bit multiplication with 16/32-bit result:
